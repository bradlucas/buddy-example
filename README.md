# buddy-example

This project shows a simple method to restrict access to certain routes with the `buddy` security library for Clojure.

This project generated using Luminus version "3.36" using the following command to start the project.


    lein new luminus buddy-example +auth


## Notes

The namespace `buddy-example.routes.restricted` has an example route that requires restriction.

The login and logout routes are in `buddy-example.routes.auth`.

The Luminus default `buddy-example.middleware` file has been changed to redirect to `/login' if a restricted page is accessed without a prior successful login.
